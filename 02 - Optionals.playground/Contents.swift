//Secure way
//You only get inside if the var is no nil

//here the same, just to watch you can use the same name

//Other secure way: Known as optional chaining (? after the var)
// is the same as "if let"
newBoxStringOptional = "Hello world!"
newBoxStringOptional?.hasPrefix("Hello") //If not nil run the method



//Unsecure and in the rought way (!)
print("Unsecure way \(newBoxStringOptional!) only runs if the var has value if not will throw an error (comment line 13 & 39 to watch it).")
